## Reading Response
The reading was one of the most interesting reading that I had in a while. The so-called "conversation" between the human and the robot during an interaction has always lacked the true sense of what a genuine interaction entails for a human-to-human conversation. This was primarily because most of the interaction that I know of regarding machine-to-human revolved around the idea of "taking turns" as the reading mentioned for the limitation of contemporary (or previous) robot-to-human performances.

As the reading suggests, timing and fluent action coordination definitely serves the most crucial part of making the conversation "live". If the robot is able to imitate the diverse timing and reaction based on the human that it is interacting with, which usually connects to the what we would call as the "alive factor", the lines between the human and the robot in not only performances, but also in general interaction will become thinner.


## Usage of Robot Dogs in a Play
When I first thought of the robot dog, one main idea reminded me that is not exactly a play but a performance done with a VR tool. The inspiration that I got was a VR performance where the performance director creates a VR version of the audience's (here it is one designated person) daughter who passed away. They gather all the images and the traits of her daughter and used that data to create her virtual self as a performance having conversation with the audience.

With this inspiration, I would love to use the robot dog to create a performance that mimics a dog of someone that passed away that not only includes action that the his/her dog used to do, but also add some verbal lines to make the user let go of the depressing memory of the having his or her dog gone from his/her life. Robot is used as a way to create the similar physical image that is more lively towards humans as it can involve the sense of touch unlike traditional VR system. Also, dog's actions are mainly intimate involving countless physical interaction with the user.
