Autonomous Robots as Performing Agents

First, this paper was written in 1996 - which meant that the use of robots in performances was a rare scene, especially those robots that perform independently.
Terming "performing agents" to a machine must have been a new phenomenon at the time but the author adds on by introducing the project RoboWoggle
that displays the idea of puppotics. Despite spending most of my time with looking at entertainment through a virtual space,
I always found a stronger relation towards a phyiscally present performing agent. The possibility of using different types of communication, as
mentioned in the paper, fascinated me once more in regards to phyiscal performing agents. With traditional robot performances, we are used to
a limited communications where most of the performances are based on director - agent and agent - agent. However, with further growth in technological appliances,
the widespread of addition of audience - agent communication has made the performance even more special. When audience interacts with the performing agent, I feel
that the performance becomes different from the typical one-way performance - the performance becomes a conversation.

Today, we are no longer limited to the IR sensors to communicate information between the agents. Other sensors such as using Bluetooth signals to connect with one or another agents,
proximity sensor to detect the surrounding distance to another object, and even sound sensor to use sound data as a part of the performance have made
the performing agents to become more versatile in the field of performance.

This only leads me to wonder what will come next - and how much more advanced will autonomous robots be as a performing agent. In the near future,
or even now, will we be able to create a autonoumous robot that can completely replace human agents as performing agents?
