"whoever uses machines [jixie] does all his work in the manner of a machine [jishi]. He who does his work in the manner of a machine lets his mind run like a machine [jixin], 
and he who carries his machine-like mind around loses his pure innocence."

Q: Do you think this is true for the society today? As we are putting our lives more towards to how robots work,
does this mean that we have shifted "our" ways to the machines? Or, is it the machines that shaped our ways
to change?

"Do human beings become masters of their machines, or their slaves? ... 
word “robot,” which originally denotes “slave” through its association with the Czech word robota, 
meaning “compulsory labor.”

Q: As robots become more like a humanoid due to our narcisstic nature of creating robots that look like humans,
will we actually start to regard robot as its original meaning that comes from the etymology of the word?

Q: Are humans actually the masters? Our daily lives are surrounded with myriads of machines/robots and without
these some will not even be able to continue their ordinary daily lives. Does this mean that we are already
in a state where we lost our pure innocence? Can we still be "purely innocent" in the era of technology?

Q: Robots and machines are, in the first place, created by humans - but then as the emergence of such technology
such as AI, in which it can self-teach itself to improve. Moreover, it is inevitable that in the upcoming years
the technology will be further advanced to the level that we will not be able to distinguish a human from a humanoid.
When humanoids hold all the characteristics to be "human", will we still be the "master" of robots? Or, will we be all
in the same hierarchy? Then, is making robots that look like human a necessary innovation?
