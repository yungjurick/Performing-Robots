The produced robot for this assignment is a small and simple sweeper robot with a
single motor attached to the rear end. The sequence that the robot follows is divided
into two segments: phase 1 is when the robot sweeps the floor by moving back and forth
in a given interval for three repetition and phase 2 is when the robot moves back and forth
in a short interval.

## Defining Robot in a Personal Way

As there are many diverse interpretation to what a robot is, I wanted to set clear my
own personal definition of a robot for this assignment: a robot comprises electrical
components that can be physically maneuvered without the use of physical human intervention.
I wanted to emphasize the "movement and dynamicality" when pointing out the definition of a robot as I believe
a robot should be able to either move its own position or move its parts.

## Process of Production

While I was cleaning my own room, repeatedly sweeping the floor in the same motion, I thought
of an idea where I can create a simple sweeper robot that can help me to move the amassed
dirt to one side. So, I started creating the rear-end motor by wrapping the motor with card-board so that
later I can attach the motor component to the base of the robot that holds the main arduino
and H-bridge.

Then, in order to build the front-end of the sweeping robot, I had to make sure that the arc-shaped
front does not deviate from its position even when the robot is moving back and forth. Since the front-side basically had to be
directly touching the surface for the whole time, I placed additional support on the arc in order to safeguard the robot from breaking down.

When I initially attached the motor component to the base without any supporting sides, whenever the robot stopped from moving one position to the next,
the motor component either kept falling or tilted to one side. So, I had to put additional supporting cardboard to each side of the motor component to prevent
the component from falling.

## The Story of Sweep-Sweep-Sweep

The story is about a sweeper machine that just loves to do its job - sweeping the floor. The first phase of the robot's movement is a repetition of the robot
moving back and forth in a consistent interval. Since the floor was already clean, leaving nothing for the sweeper to clean, a person throws things in front
of the robot - a job that the robot was missing. As the robot believes there is finally something to sweep, it continues to sweep all the things that the person
throws in front of him. However, when the person had nothing else to throw, the sweeper became in a void state but insatiated. So, it rapidly moves back and forth
to indicate to the person to throw something at it. Then, the story ends with the person throwing another object - and the sweeper continues to sweep.
