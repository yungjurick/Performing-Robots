The character in a plaay that I would want to make a robot actor to perform is Macbeth
from the play "Macbeth". Macbeth is a character that changes its mood and emotion
throughout the play from start to end, and to imitate the following characteristics
through a robot is a strenuous task. In order to effectively facilitate the similar experience,
the actor should be built with a humanoid form with flexible joints for both the torsos and neck
in order to show the smooth movement of the original actor of the play. In regards to technical feature,
since the emotion (or even speech delivered by Macbeth) generally involve diverse arm and hand movements,
the movement of the body should not be in a linear speed. In order to mimic the movement, it should have
different speed to replicate the human actor. I belive that dressing of the robot will not play a huge role
but dressing the actor with a medieval costume to portray the dress of the original character. In regards
to the sequence of movements, I thought of a movement when the robot actor is giving a speech one arm should
point to the sky and the other arm should point towards to the chest while facing the audience. This will
allow the audience to believe that the robot is reading the lines towards the audience.
