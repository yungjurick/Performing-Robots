### Reading Response

The narrative nonhuman actor in the reading was an interesting perspective as I was most intrigued by the part where as our perceptual gap between
the human and nonhuman decreases, our encounter with mechanical creations increases. The various methods of using this nonhuman actors merged within
theater allows the audience to bridge the unseeable gap between them and the non-human. What I was most intrigued was the our perception towards
anthropomorphizing the non-human actors to make the audience feel more "natural" and part of us. However, this attempt, as Vernprala mentions, it relies on
the "acting" of human and shows our natural tendency to make it look human. Meanwhile, I still think there is a need to differentiate the two. We clearly
need a distinction from robots, but when robots become too real with artificial intelligence that completely mimics the way we act - how will we know
what is truly a human being? The ticks of the checklist of being a human is slowly being similarly applied to robots - and when even robots are created with
biological components - will then they also be called as "non-human"? It made me rethink about what we think qualifies as a human - the only thing for now
would be the biological parts, but as the nonhuman actors advance technologically, we need a clear distinction that can allow us to be different. It is
no longer easy for robots to be easily identified different from human actors.
